# Use @wavtopia/core-storage instead of @prisma/client for Prisma types and client access

Do not import directly from @prisma/client in backend or media services.
Instead, import Prisma types and client from @wavtopia/core-storage.
This ensures consistent database access and type usage across services.

❌ Don't:

```ts
import { TrackEventType } from "@prisma/client";
import { prisma } from "@prisma/client";
```

✅ Do:

```ts
import { TrackEventType } from "@wavtopia/core-storage";
import { prisma } from "@wavtopia/core-storage";
```

Note: If you need a type that isn't exported from core-storage, add it to the re-exports in packages/core-storage/src/index.ts rather than importing directly from @prisma/client
