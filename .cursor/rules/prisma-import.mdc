# Use @wavtopia/core-storage instead of @prisma/client for Prisma types and client access

globs:
- packages/backend/**/*.ts
- packages/media/**/*.ts

Do not import directly from @prisma/client in backend or media services.
Instead, import Prisma types and client from @wavtopia/core-storage.
This ensures consistent database access and type usage across services.

❌ Don't:
```ts
import { TrackEventType } from '@prisma/client'
import { prisma } from '@prisma/client'
```

✅ Do:
```ts
import { TrackEventType } from '@wavtopia/core-storage'
import { prisma } from '@wavtopia/core-storage'
```

Note: If you need a type that isn't exported from core-storage, add it to the re-exports in packages/core-storage/src/index.ts rather than importing directly from @prisma/client
