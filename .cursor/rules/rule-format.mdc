# Cursor Rule Frontmatter Protocol

Rules must use the `.mdc` extension and include these frontmatter fields:
```yaml
---
description: ""    # Only set for Agent Requested rules
globs: []         # Only set for Auto Attached rules
alwaysApply: false  # Set true for Always rules
---
```

Types:
- Manual (default): Empty description/globs
- Auto Attached: Set globs patterns
- Always: Set alwaysApply: true
- Agent Requested: Set description

Keep rules concise - they should be short and focused while retaining all essential information.
