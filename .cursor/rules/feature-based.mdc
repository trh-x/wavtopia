# Feature-Based Organization

Prefer organizing code by feature/domain rather than technical layer:

```
✅ Feature-based:
feature/
  components/
  hooks/
  utils/
  types.ts
  api.ts

❌ Layer-based:
components/
  feature1/
  feature2/
hooks/
  feature1/
  feature2/
utils/
  feature1/
  feature2/
```

Exceptions:
1. Shared/common code (utils, types, components used across features)
2. Platform-specific code (mobile vs web)
3. Infrastructure code (database, auth, etc)
