# React Component Guidelines

Component files must follow this structure:

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface Props {
  // TypeScript required
  propName: PropType;
}

export const Component: React.FC<Props> = ({ propName }) => {
  return <div className="flex items-center">{propName}</div>;
};
```

Structure Requirements:

1. File name matches component name (PascalCase)
2. Imports → Types → Component
3. One component per file
4. TypeScript required
5. Extract reusable logic to hooks
6. Keep components focused/single-responsibility
7. Use feature-based organization (group related components, hooks, and utils by feature)
